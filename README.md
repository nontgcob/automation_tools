# Welcome to nontgcob automation_tools toolkit

This is a place that I write my program to do things for me mostly related to text and files management because these things can be very tedious at times and they are quite repetitive and labor-intensive, so as a programmer myself, I leverage my superpower to create tools to help me work faster (in the long run).
